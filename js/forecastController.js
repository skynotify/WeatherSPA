/*
A Note Regarding API Usage
An important note regarding API usage

We use the free openweathermap API to get weather data. Openweathermap now requires a free sign up to use their data, and they email you a key that you include in the URL when you request data.

To get your weather app working you will need to do the following:

1) Follow the instructions here: http://openweathermap.org/appid to sign up, and retrieve your API key.

2) Use this URL to get weather data (services.js):
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?APPID=YOURAPIKEY

Be sure to put the API Key you get from openweathermap in place of the phrase 'YOURAPIKEY'.
